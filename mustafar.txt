Anakin: YOU TURNED HER AGAINST ME!?

Obi Wan: You have done that yourself.

(He glares at his former master as he decloaks, with Obi Wan doing the same.)

Anakin: YOU WILL NOT TAKE HER FROM ME!!!

Obi Wan: Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.

Obi Wan: You have allowed this dark lord to twist your mind until now....until now, you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.

Anakin: Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan; I see through the lies of the Jedi...I do not fear the dark side as you do!

Anakin: I have brought peace...freedom....justice, and security to my new empire.

(Obi Wan stares at him in disbelief, unable to comprehend what he had just said.)

Obi Wan: Your new empire!?

Anakin: Donâ€™t make me kill you!

Obi Wan: Anakin, my allegiance...is to the Republic! To DEMOCRACY!


Anakin: If you're not with me...then you are my enemy.

(...Obi Wan now realized that there was no other way out of this.)

Obi Wan: Only a sith deals in absolutes...I will do what I must.

(He gets in his position, with Anakin sensing this.)

Anakin:...you will try.
